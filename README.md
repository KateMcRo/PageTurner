## Description
Full stack CMS-style book review application. Users can create an account, login, post and review books. Upon visiting the app, the user will be presented with a Get Started image that a user can click which will send them to a sign-up page. If the user were to click on dashboard, or any of the books on the home page, they would also be redirected to the log in page. A user can then either create an account or log in to an account from the respective views. When the user is logged in, they can click on the books displayed on the home page to redirect them to a view of that book and a review by the user who added it. When the user is logged in, they are able to press the dashboard link in the navigation to redirect them to the users personal dashboard. Here they are able to view their added books. When the user clicks on the book in their dashboard, they are presented with a view of that book that allows the user to add a post about that book. On the dashboard, the user is also able to add a new book to the site. When the user clicks on the add book button, they are presented with a form that allows them to add a book to the site. When the user clicks on the logout button, they are logged out of the site and redirected to the homepage. When the user is idle on the site for more than a set time, they are signed off. The app follows MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
