      "body_review": "Oh, joy, another opportunity to delve into the mundanity of Douglas Adams's So Long and Thanks for All the Fish. This book, much like existence itself, offers a tedious blend of absurdity and mediocrity. Arthur Dent finds himself back on Earth amidst a perplexing resurgence, yet Adams's attempt to infuse the narrative with wit falls short, resulting in a lackluster endeavor. Regrettably, this installment fails to match the brilliance of its predecessors, dragging along with fleeting moments of amusement and a sense of disappointment. If you seek a truly captivating and immersive experience, look elsewhere, for this book lacks the charm and brilliance that once made the series so captivating. Brace yourself for a journey through the mundane rather than the extraordinary.",
